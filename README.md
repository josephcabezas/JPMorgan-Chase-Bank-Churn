# Project Background
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

As one of the largest financial institutions in the world, JPMorgan Chase Bank serves millions of customers with a wide range of financial products and services. In such a highly competitive industry, retaining customers is essential for sustaining profitability and maintaining market leadership. Customer churn—the rate at which customers stop using the bank’s products or services—is of significant importance for JPMorgan, as it directly impacts revenue and increases customer acquisition costs.

The problem JPMorgan faces is identifying which customers are at risk of leaving and understanding the factors that drive this churn. With a large customer base, subtle behavioral patterns that could predict future churn can often go unnoticed. I conducted a comprehensive analysis of customer churn, leveraging a dataset that includes key customer information such as age, credit score, salary, product usage, and other features. This project visualizes the data, evaluates these features, and contains a machine learning model that predicts which customers are most likely to churn, uncovering critical business insights. 

By identifying these customers early on, JPMorgan can make data-driven decisions about implementing targeted retention strategies, reducing churn rates, and minimizing customer attrition, thereby increasing customer lifetime value and ensuring long-term growth.

*Disclaimer: The dataset used in this project is a realistic sample created to simulate JPMorgan customer data and does not represent actual customer information.*
